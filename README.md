## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm i
```

## Usage

After the user opens the directory in the command line, they can run:

```bash
node index.js
```

to begin the CLI application. They are then prompted to enter up to 3 characters for their logo, a color for the text, a shape for the logo, and a color for the shape. The command line will then indicate that a logo.svg file has been generated. The user can then find the file in the "output" folder in the main directory of the application.
